# Monitoring Plan for Agricultural Threat Detection System

This document outlines the comprehensive monitoring strategy for our agricultural threat detection system, covering both system performance monitoring and machine learning model monitoring aspects.

## 1. System Monitoring

### 1.1 Infrastructure Monitoring

#### Key Metrics
- **CPU Utilization**: Monitor across all services with thresholds at 80% for warnings and 90% for critical alerts
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption with alerts at 80% and 90% thresholds
- **Disk Space**: Alert when disk usage exceeds 75% and 90%
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor bandwidth usage, connection counts, and latency
- **Container Health**: Track container restarts, resource usage, and health checks

#### Implementation
- Use Prometheus for metrics collection with node-exporter for system metrics
- Implement Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Set up alerting via Alertmanager with integration to incident management system
- Use SigNoz for distributed tracing across microservices

### 1.2 Application Performance Monitoring

#### Key Metrics
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second for each API endpoint
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors (4xx/5xx)
- **Latency**: Track p50, p90, p95, and p99 response times
- **Throughput**: Number of images processed per minute
- **Resource Utilization**: Per-request resource consumption

#### Implementation
- Use OpenTelemetry instrumentation for API endpoints
- Configure SigNoz to capture request traces and service dependencies
- Create Grafana dashboards with RED (Rate, Error, Duration) metrics
- Set up custom logging for application-specific events

### 1.3 Database Monitoring

#### Key Metrics
- **Query Performance**: Track slow queries and execution times
- **Connection Pool**: Monitor active connections and wait times
- **Transaction Volume**: Track read/write operations per second
- **Storage Growth**: Monitor database size growth rate

#### Implementation
- Use database exporter for Prometheus (PostgreSQL exporter)
- Create dedicated Grafana dashboard for database metrics
- Implement query performance analysis tools

## 2. ML Model Monitoring

### 2.1 Model Performance Metrics

#### Key Metrics
- **Inference Latency**: Time to process an image and return predictions
- **Prediction Distribution**: Distribution of prediction classes and confidence scores
- **Batch Processing Performance**: Throughput for batch prediction jobs
- **GPU Utilization**: For models using GPU acceleration

#### Implementation
- Custom Prometheus metrics for model performance
- Dedicated Grafana dashboard for ML performance visualization
- Regular reporting on resource utilization vs. throughput

### 2.2 Data Quality Monitoring

#### Key Metrics
- **Input Data Statistics**: Track distribution of image sizes, quality scores, metadata
- **Missing Values**: Monitor proportion of missing metadata or corrupted images
- **Data Validation Failures**: Rate of images failing pre-processing validation

#### Implementation
- Implement data quality checks in the data ingestion pipeline
- Create automated reports for data quality metrics
- Set up alerting for significant changes in data characteristics

### 2.3 Drift Detection

#### Approach Based on Ground Truth Availability

##### With Ground Truth Available
- **Label Drift**: Monitor changes in the distribution of actual ground truth labels
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Track model accuracy, precision, recall over time
- **Confusion Matrix Evolution**: Monitor changes in confusion matrix patterns
- **Implementation**: Periodic retraining evaluations with new labeled data

##### Without Ground Truth (Unsupervised)
- **Feature Drift**: Statistical tests (KS-test, JS divergence) on input feature distributions
- **Prediction Drift**: Monitor changes in prediction distribution
- **Confidence Scores**: Track changes in confidence score distributions
- **Implementation**: Implement automated drift detection using statistical methods

#### Implementation Details
- Baseline reference dataset for drift comparison
- Scheduled drift detection jobs (daily/weekly)
- Visualization of drift metrics over time
- Alerting when drift exceeds predefined thresholds

### 2.4 Model Explainability Monitoring

#### Key Metrics
- **Feature Importance Stability**: Track changes in feature importance rankings
- **Explanation Consistency**: Monitor consistency of explanations for similar inputs
- **Boundary Case Analysis**: Track model behavior at decision boundaries

#### Implementation
- Implement SHAP or LIME for regular explanation generation
- Create visualization dashboards for explanation metrics
- Set up periodic reporting on explanation stability

## 3. Alert Management and Response

### 3.1 Alert Prioritization

- **P0 (Critical)**: Service downtime, data loss, security breaches
- **P1 (High)**: Significant performance degradation, high error rates
- **P2 (Medium)**: Moderate performance issues, concerning drift patterns
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor issues, early warning signals

### 3.2 Response Procedures

#### System Issues
1. Automatic scaling for resource constraints
2. Predefined runbooks for common failure scenarios
3. Rollback procedures for deployments

#### Model Issues
1. Model fallback mechanisms for prediction errors
2. Retraining triggers based on drift thresholds
3. Data validation enhancement procedures

## 4. Continuous Improvement

### 4.1 Monitoring Effectiveness Review

- Monthly review of monitoring coverage and effectiveness
- Refinement of alert thresholds based on false positive/negative rates
- Addition of new metrics based on incident analysis

### 4.2 Automated Reporting

- Weekly system health reports
- Monthly model performance reports
- Quarterly comprehensive review with trend analysis

## 5. Tools and Infrastructure

### 5.1 Monitoring Stack

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus, OpenTelemetry
- **Visualization**: Grafana, SigNoz
- **Tracing**: SigNoz (OpenTelemetry)
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager, integration with PagerDuty/Slack
- **Log Management**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### 5.2 ML-specific Tools

- **Drift Detection**: Custom implementation using statistical methods
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
- **Model Registry**: MLflow Model Registry
- **Feature Store**: Optional based on project scale

## 6. Governance and Documentation

### 6.1 Monitoring Ownership

- Infrastructure monitoring: DevOps team
- Application monitoring: Development team
- ML model monitoring: Data Science team

### 6.2 Documentation Requirements

- Runbooks for alert response
- Regular updates to monitoring documentation
- Change log for monitoring configuration
- Performance baselines and thresholds
