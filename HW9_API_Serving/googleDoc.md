# 20. Model Serving Plan

## Overview of Model Serving Architecture

For serving our agricultural threat detection model, we've developed a comprehensive architecture that includes the following components:

1. **User Interfaces**:
   - Streamlit UI for interactive engagement with the model
   - Gradio UI as an alternative interface with additional visualization features

2. **API Server**:
   - FastAPI for high-performance API with automatic documentation
   - Endpoints for image upload and prediction retrieval

3. **Kubernetes Infrastructure**:
   - Separate deployments for API and user interfaces
   - Auto-scaling based on load
   - Configuration management through ConfigMaps
   - Health and readiness checks

## Comparison of Model Serving Servers

| Server | Advantages | Disadvantages | Suitable Use Cases |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **FastAPI (current solution)** | - High performance<br>- Automatic documentation<br>- Asynchronous processing | - Limited parallel execution for GPU | Small to medium deployments with moderate load |
| **TorchServe** | - Optimized for PyTorch<br>- Model version management<br>- Dynamic loading | - More complex configuration<br>- Limited TensorFlow support | Large PyTorch models with high availability requirements |
| **TensorFlow Serving** | - High-performance serving<br>- Optimized for TensorFlow<br>- Built-in version management | - Not optimal for other frameworks | TensorFlow models with high performance requirements |
| **Triton Inference Server** | - Multi-framework support<br>- High throughput<br>- Dynamic scaling | - More complex setup<br>- Larger resource footprint | Mixed workloads with multiple models in different formats |
| **Seldon Core** | - Canary deployments<br>- A/B testing<br>- Model explainability | - Requires more resources<br>- More complex management | Workloads requiring complex routing and canary testing |
| **KServe** | - Declarative deployment<br>- Built-in transformers<br>- Auto-scaling | - More complex setup<br>- Requires mature K8s cluster | Enterprise deployments requiring declarative management |

## Production Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment (current)
- Implementation of FastAPI server and user interfaces
- Deployment in Kubernetes with basic auto-scaling
- Setup of basic monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Optimization and Scaling (1-3 months)
- Introduction of Triton Inference Server for improved performance
- Setup of result caching for frequently requested images
- Expansion of monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Addition of business-level metrics and data drift tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Serving Capabilities (3-6 months)
- Implementation of Seldon Core or KServe for complex routing and canary deployments
- Implementation of A/B testing for comparing model versions
- Automatic retraining based on user feedback
- Integration with MLflow for experiment and model version tracking

## Deployment Strategies

For our model, we've considered the following deployment strategies:

1. **Current: Rolling Update**
   - Gradual replacement of old pods with new ones
   - Zero downtime during updates
   - Low risk with proper readiness checks configuration

2. **Future consideration: Canary Deployment**
   - Testing the new version on a small percentage of traffic
   - Gradual increase in traffic share with successful operation
   - Ideal for A/B testing of new model versions

3. **Future consideration: Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Maintaining two identical environments (blue and green)
   - Instant switching between versions
   - Allows for quick rollback in case of issues

## Monitoring and Feedback

To ensure reliability and quality of model serving, we plan to implement:

1. **Technical Monitoring**:
   - API request latency
   - System throughput
   - Resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory)
   - Service uptime

2. **Model Quality Monitoring**:
   - Data drift tracking
   - Collection of user feedback on prediction accuracy
   - Automatic calculation of performance metrics on test data

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - Number of unique users
   - System usage frequency
   - Time saved by agronomists
   - Economic effect of system use

## Conclusion

The model serving plan provides a phased path from initial deployment to a full-fledged production system with advanced capabilities. The combination of FastAPI, Kubernetes, and specialized model serving servers will provide the optimal balance of performance, flexibility, and ease of management for our agricultural threat detection project.
