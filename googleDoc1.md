Design Document for the Project "Organizing Access to a RAG Repository of Information on Threats to Agricultural Crops"
This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for a project aimed at organizing access to a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) repository containing instructions, reference materials, and data on threats to agricultural crops (weeds, pests, diseases). The project includes creating a database, a wiki for web and mobile applications, and a RAG repository for processing queries with indexed images. The possibility of fine-tuning a local small-scale model is also considered.

A database with texts and images about weeds, pests, and diseases.
A wiki interface for web and mobile applications.
A RAG repository for quick search and delivery of relevant information.
The option to fine-tune a local model for query processing.
2. Models in Production
The project will utilize the following models and components:
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Used to combine information retrieval from the database with response generation. A pre-trained model (e.g., Llama 3 or BERT) will be adapted for processing queries in Ukrainian.
Local Small-Scale Model: Fine-tuning a model like DistilBERT or MobileBERT for local deployment on resource-constrained servers.
Search Index: Elasticsearch and FAISS for fast text and image retrieval from the database.
Database: PostgreSQL for storing structured information (texts, metadata, categories) and MinIO for storing images.
Architecture
Data Collection: Python scripts (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) for gathering information from open sources (agricultural websites, scientific articles, databases).
Data Processing: NLP pipeline for text cleaning, categorization, and indexing. Using spaCy and Hugging Face libraries for processing Ukrainian texts.
RAG Repository: Combines FAISS for vector search and Llama 3 for response generation.
API: FastAPI for creating a RESTful API to provide access to the wiki and RAG repository.
Frontend: React for the web application and React Native for the mobile application.
