# HW14: Tools, LLMs and Data Moat

<!-- Оновлена версія для PR -->
This homework implements monitoring and continuous improvement for both traditional ML models and LLMs in our agricultural threat detection system.

## Project Structure

- **PR1_utilizing_a_managed_model_monitoring_tool**: Integration with Arize.ai for model monitoring
- **PR2_LLM_monitoring**: LangSmith integration for LLM monitoring and evaluation
- **PR3_closing_the_loop**: Creating data enrichment pipelines from monitoring insights

## Features

- Comprehensive model monitoring with Arize.ai
- LLM observability through LangSmith
- Data drift detection and analysis
- Automated labeling task generation
- Complete feedback loop implementation
- Data moat strategy (added to Google Doc)

## Setup Instructions

Each PR directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions.

## Data Moat Strategy

A comprehensive data moat strategy has been added to the Google Doc, detailing how to:

1. Collect valuable data from production
2. Implement active learning pipelines
3. Leverage user feedback loops
4. Generate synthetic data
5. Build proprietary datasets
6. Continuously improve models

The strategy provides a roadmap for creating a sustainable competitive advantage through data.
