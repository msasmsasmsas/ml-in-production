Task:

For this task, you will need both a training and an inference pipeline. The training pipeline should include at least the following steps: Load Training Data, Train Model, Save Trained Models. Additional steps may be added as desired. Similarly, the inference pipeline should include at least the following steps: Load Data for Inference, Load Trained Model, Run Inference, Save Inference Results. You may also add extra steps to this pipeline as needed.

    Update the Google Doc with the pipeline section for your use case, and compare Kubeflow, Airflow, and Dagster.
